          <p>
            Shakespeare used it to refer to finding oneself in a difficult
            position in The Tempest. In the 1611 play, Alonso asks Trinculo,
            “How camest thou in this pickle?” to which Trinculo responds, “I
            have been in such a pickle since I saw you last that, I fear me,
            will never out of my bones: I shall not fear fly-blowing.”

            According to the U.S. Supreme Court, pickles are technically a
            “fruit” of the vine (like tomatoes), but they are generally known as
            a vegetable.

            Approximately 100,000 to 125,000 acres are devoted to growing
            pickling cucumbers in the United States.

            Cleopatra ate pickles because she believed they were one of the
            things that helped her stay beautiful.

            Pickles got their start more than 4,000 years ago, when ancient
            Mesopotamians began soaking cucumbers in acidic brine, as a way to
            preserve them. Since then, they have been a staple in cultures
            around the globe, renowned for their heartiness, health benefits and
            delicious taste.

            Pickles were first brought to America by Christopher Columbus. (Like
            many explorers, he loved traveling with them because they could
            survive the long journeys, and they helped prevent scurvy.) By the
            19th century, H.J. Heinz Company, Inc. had cornered the market,
            thanks to some truly ingenious marketing strategies. By the 2010s,
            Americans alone were eating more than 2 million pounds of pickles a
